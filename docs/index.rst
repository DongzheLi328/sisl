   :description: sisl is a tool to manipulate density functional
		 theory code input and/or output. It also implements tight-binding
		 tools to create and manipulate multi-orbital (non)-orthogonal basis sets.

sisl: a tight-binding and DFT postprocessing library
====================================================

sisl is an open source Python library to manipulate density functional
theory code input and/or output.
It also allows constructing and analyzing custom made tight-binding models with high
throughput for millions of orbitals/atoms.
Any user tight-binding model may be used as input to the non-equilibrium Green function
transport calculator `TBtrans`_.
sisl deals with both electrons and phonons.

sisl is hosted on Github `here <http://github.com/zerothi/sisl>`_.

Tight-binding and localized orbitals are an essential part of the electronic structure
community. A great deal of codes are implementing either of the afore mentioned methodologies.
However, every code implements their own analysis and post-processing utilities which typically
turns out to be equivalent utilities only having the interface differently.

sisl tries to solve some of the analysis issues by creating a unified scripting approach
in Python which does analysis using the same interface, regardless of code being used.
For instance one may read the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue spectrum from various codes and return them
in a consistent manner so the post-processing is the same, regardless of code being used.

Tight-binding models are created dynamically in sisl using a custom sparse Hamiltonian.
Having *any* electronic structure one can calculate physical properties such as (projected)
density of states, wavefunctions, spin moments, band velocities and Berry phases.


Features
--------

sisl consists of several distinct features:

* Geometries; create, extend, combine, manipulate different geometries readed from
  a large variety of DFT-codes and/or from generically used file formats.

* Hamiltonian; easily create tight-binding Hamiltonians with user chosen number of
  orbitals per atom. Or read in Hamiltonians from DFT software such as `Siesta`_,
  `Wannier90`_, `GULP`_ etc. Secondly, there is intrinsic capability of orthogonal
  *and* non-orthogonal Hamiltonians.

* Post-process output from several DFT codes: `Siesta`_,
  `Wannier90`_, `VASP`_, `OpenMX`_, `GULP`_, `BigDFT`_, see `sisl.io` for a complete
  list of allowed files.

* Command line utilities for processing of data files for a wide
  variety of file formats.
